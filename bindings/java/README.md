# lean-pq Java bindings

Java 25 bindings for [leanVM](https://github.com/leanEthereum/leanVM)'s post-quantum signatures
and their zkVM-backed aggregation:

- **leanXMSS**: stateful. A key signs at unsigned 32-bit leaf indices; never sign two different
  messages at the same leaf index.
- **leanSPHINCS**: stateless. A key keeps one subtree of height `keptHeight` (at most 26), which
  trades signing capacity for key generation time.

Both schemes use 32-byte public keys and sign 32-byte messages. Signatures are plain `byte[]`
values: 2404 bytes for leanXMSS and 4276 bytes for leanSPHINCS. An `Aggregate` proves that each
listed public key signed its message, across both schemes, and can absorb earlier aggregates
recursively.

The public API is a named Java module, `org.ethereum.leanpq`, built on Java's finalized Foreign
Function & Memory API (FFM/Panama). Native objects are wrapped in `AutoCloseable` types; use
try-with-resources for `XmssSecretKey`, `SphincsSecretKey`, and `Aggregate`.

## Install

Published on Maven Central as `io.github.crate-crypto:lean-pq`; its version matches the
repository's release tag (`vX.Y.Z` is `X.Y.Z`). It needs JDK 25.

Gradle (Kotlin DSL):

<!-- x-release-please-start-version -->
```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation("io.github.crate-crypto:lean-pq:0.6.2")
}
```
<!-- x-release-please-end -->

Maven:

<!-- x-release-please-start-version -->
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.github.crate-crypto</groupId>
  <artifactId>lean-pq</artifactId>
  <version>0.6.2</version>
</dependency>
```
<!-- x-release-please-end -->

## Native-access permission

The library is a named module, `org.ethereum.leanpq`. A modular application grants it native
access narrowly:

```sh
java --enable-native-access=org.ethereum.leanpq ...
```

On the class path the library is part of the unnamed module, so the flag becomes
`--enable-native-access=ALL-UNNAMED`. Gradle's JUnit runner executes on the class path, so the
repository test task uses that broader form.

## Native library

The jar bundles the native library for:

| Platform | Resource in the jar |
| --- | --- |
| Linux x86_64, glibc 2.17 or newer (CPU with AVX2 and PCLMULQDQ) | `org/ethereum/leanpq/native/linux-x86_64/liblean_pq_native.so` |
| Linux aarch64, glibc 2.17 or newer | `org/ethereum/leanpq/native/linux-aarch64/liblean_pq_native.so` |
| macOS arm64 and x86_64 (one universal library; x86_64 needs AVX2 and PCLMULQDQ) | `org/ethereum/leanpq/native/macos-universal/liblean_pq_native.dylib` |
| Windows x86_64 (Windows 10 or newer; CPU with AVX2 and PCLMULQDQ) | `org/ethereum/leanpq/native/windows-x86_64/lean_pq_native.dll` |

On Linux and macOS, first use copies the library into a new owner-only directory under
`java.io.tmpdir`, loads it, and deletes the copy; that directory must allow executable mappings.
Windows cannot delete a loaded DLL, so there the library is installed once per build as
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\lean-pq\native\<SHA-256 of the DLL>\lean_pq_native.dll` and reused by later JVMs
only while its bytes match the jar's copy; a missing or different file is rewritten atomically.
Each release adds one directory there, which can be deleted while no JVM uses it. The DLL is built
for `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu` and imports only DLLs that ship with Windows, so it needs no Visual C++
or MinGW runtime. Other platforms, including musl-based Linux and Windows on arm64, fail with an
error naming the platform.

To load a different build instead, set `-Dlean.pq.native.path=/path/to/liblean_pq_native.so`
(or `.dylib`, or `lean_pq_native.dll`) before first use; the bundled libraries are then ignored. Build one with
`cargo build --release -p lean-pq-native` from the repository root.

## Build and test

Requirements: JDK 25, Gradle 9.1 or newer, and Rust (stable toolchain). From the repository root:

```sh
gradle -p bindings/java test
```

The test task builds the shared `lean_pq_native` library in release mode (debug builds of leanVM
prove roughly 30x slower) and supplies its path through `-Dlean.pq.native.path`. One aggregation
takes seconds and roughly 1.6 GB of memory.

`gradle -p bindings/java jar` bundles the freshly built host library only. To bundle prebuilt
libraries instead, pass `-PleanPqNativeDir=DIR`, where `DIR/<platform>/` holds the library for each
platform in the table above; `scripts/build-native.sh <platform> DIR` builds one (the Linux builds
need [Zig 0.15.2](https://ziglang.org/download/) and `cargo install cargo-zigbuild`, the macOS
build needs a Mac, and the Windows build needs Windows with Git Bash, the `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`
Rust target and MinGW-w64's `gcc` and `objdump` on `PATH`). Local builds have version `0.0.0-SNAPSHOT`; `-Pversion=X.Y.Z` overrides it.

`scripts/consumer-smoke.sh [GRADLE_ARGS...]` publishes the artifact to a throwaway Maven
repository, builds a fresh modular project depending on `io.github.crate-crypto:lean-pq` from it,
and runs that project with `--enable-native-access=org.ethereum.leanpq` and no
`lean.pq.native.path`, signing, verifying and aggregating with both schemes; on Windows (under
Git Bash) it runs the consumer twice and checks that both runs use the single cached DLL. CI runs it
on Linux x86_64 and the release workflow on every bundled platform; set `GRADLE` if Gradle is not on
`PATH`.

## Releasing

`.github/workflows/release.yml` publishes on every `vX.Y.Z` tag: `java-native` builds and checks
each platform's library, and `java-publish` bundles all four in the jar, runs the consumer smoke
against it, then signs and uploads it to the Central Portal, releasing it once the Portal validates
the deployment. A version can be published only once.

One-time setup, with the `io.github.crate-crypto` namespace verified on
[central.sonatype.com](https://central.sonatype.com/publishing/namespaces):

1. Generate a Portal user token: sign in to the Central Portal, open
   <https://central.sonatype.com/usertoken>, press **Generate User Token**, and copy the username
   and password it shows once.
2. Generate a signing key and publish its public half:

   ```sh
   gpg --quick-generate-key "lean-pq release signing <maintainer@example.org>" rsa4096 sign 2y
   gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format long    # note the 40-hex-digit fingerprint
   gpg --armor --export FINGERPRINT > lean-pq-signing.asc
   ```

   Upload `lean-pq-signing.asc` at <https://keys.openpgp.org/upload> and confirm the verification
   e-mail so the key is published with its identity (or
   `gpg --keyserver keys.openpgp.org --send-keys FINGERPRINT`, then request verification on that
   site). Central looks the key up there to check signatures.
3. Export the private key, ASCII-armored:

   ```sh
   gpg --armor --export-secret-keys FINGERPRINT
   ```

4. Add the repository secrets (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions):

   | Secret | Value |
   | --- | --- |
   | `MAVEN_CENTRAL_USERNAME` | the user token's username |
   | `MAVEN_CENTRAL_PASSWORD` | the user token's password |
   | `SIGNING_KEY` | the whole exported private key, including the `BEGIN`/`END` lines |
   | `SIGNING_PASSWORD` | the key's passphrase |

The workflow passes them to the [`com.vanniktech.maven.publish`](https://vanniktech.github.io/gradle-maven-publish-plugin/central/)
Gradle plugin as `ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_mavenCentralUsername`, `ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_mavenCentralPassword`,
`ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_signingInMemoryKey` and `ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_signingInMemoryKeyPassword`.
Builds without `signingInMemoryKey` skip signing. Before the key expires, extend it with
`gpg --quick-set-expire FINGERPRINT 2y`, upload the public key again, and update `SIGNING_KEY`.

## Sign and verify

```java
import org.ethereum.leanpq.*;

try (XmssSecretKey xmss = XmssSecretKey.fromSeed(seed32);
     SphincsSecretKey sphincs = SphincsSecretKey.fromSeed(otherSeed32, 4)) {
    byte[] xmssSignature = xmss.sign(message32, 7);
    boolean xmssValid = LeanPq.xmssVerify(xmss.publicKey(), message32, xmssSignature);

    byte[] sphincsSignature = sphincs.sign(message32);
    boolean sphincsValid = LeanPq.sphincsVerify(sphincs.publicKey(), message32, sphincsSignature);
}
```

leanXMSS keys are stateful: persist your own durable high-water leaf index alongside
`XmssSecretKey.toBytes()` and advance it before publishing a signature. `prepare(leafIndex)`
precomputes signing state ahead of time. Secret-key bytes are secret material: the 32-byte
leanXMSS seed, or the 32-byte leanSPHINCS seed followed by its kept height.

## Aggregation

`LeanPq.aggregate(children, xmss, sphincs)` verifies every raw signature before proving, accepts
at most 16 children, and runs one proof at a time per process. `Aggregate.fromBytes` verifies the
proof it decodes and throws `LeanPqException` otherwise, so every `Aggregate` is proven. An
aggregate attests the claims it lists, not the claims you wanted: compare `xmssClaims()` and
`sphincsClaims()` against what you expect. `LeanPq.setup()` moves the one-time guest build ahead of
the first proof; calling it is optional and idempotent.

```java
import java.util.List;
import org.ethereum.leanpq.*;

try (Aggregate leaf = LeanPq.aggregate(
         List.of(),
         List.of(new SignedMessage(xmss.publicKey(), message32, xmss.sign(message32, 7))),
         List.of(new SignedMessage(sphincs.publicKey(), message32, sphincs.sign(message32))));
     Aggregate root = LeanPq.aggregate(List.of(leaf), List.of(), List.of());
     Aggregate received = Aggregate.fromBytes(root.toBytes())) {
    List<SignatureClaim> xmssClaims = received.xmssClaims();
    List<SignatureClaim> sphincsClaims = received.sphincsClaims();
}
```

The native ABI in [`../native`](../native) is an internal implementation detail shared by
managed-language bindings, not a stable C API.
