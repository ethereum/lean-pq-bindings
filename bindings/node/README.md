# lean-pq Node.js bindings

Node.js bindings for [leanVM](https://github.com/leanEthereum/leanVM)'s post-quantum signatures,
leanXMSS and leanSPHINCS, and their recursive aggregation. Implemented with Rust and `napi-rs`
over the safe `lean-pq` Rust crate; they do not use the repository's C bridge.

- **leanXMSS** is stateful: a key signs at `2^32` leaf indices; never sign two different messages
  at the same leaf index.
- **leanSPHINCS** is stateless: a key keeps one subtree of height `keptHeight` (at most 26),
  trading signing capacity for key generation time.

Public keys and messages are 32-byte `Buffer`s; signatures are `Buffer`s of 2404 (leanXMSS) or
4276 (leanSPHINCS) bytes. Key generation, preparation, signing, setup, aggregation, and aggregate
decoding return Promises so their native work does not block the JavaScript event loop.

## Install

<!-- x-release-please-start-version -->
```sh
npm install @kevaundray/lean-pq@0.9.0
```
<!-- x-release-please-end -->

npm installs a prebuilt binary through a per-platform optional dependency, so installing needs
no Rust toolchain. Prebuilt binaries cover Node.js 18.17 or later on:

| Platform                 | Package                              |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Linux x64, glibc 2.17+   | `@kevaundray/lean-pq-linux-x64-gnu`    |
| Linux arm64, glibc 2.17+ | `@kevaundray/lean-pq-linux-arm64-gnu`  |
| Linux x64, musl          | `@kevaundray/lean-pq-linux-x64-musl`   |
| Linux arm64, musl        | `@kevaundray/lean-pq-linux-arm64-musl` |
| macOS x64                | `@kevaundray/lean-pq-darwin-x64`       |
| macOS arm64              | `@kevaundray/lean-pq-darwin-arm64`     |
| Windows x64              | `@kevaundray/lean-pq-win32-x64-msvc`   |

The x64 binaries require a CPU with AVX2 and PCLMULQDQ. The Windows binary links the C runtime
statically, so it needs no Visual C++ redistributable. Installing with `--omit=optional` or
`--no-optional` skips the binary and leaves the package unable to load.

## Sign and verify

```js
const lpq = require('@kevaundray/lean-pq')

const message = Buffer.alloc(32, 0x42)

const xmssKey = await lpq.XmssSecretKey.fromSeed(Buffer.alloc(32, 1))
const xmssSignature = await xmssKey.sign(message, 7)
lpq.xmssVerify(xmssKey.publicKey, message, xmssSignature) // throws if invalid

const sphincsKey = await lpq.SphincsSecretKey.fromSeed(Buffer.alloc(32, 2), 4)
const sphincsSignature = await sphincsKey.sign(message)
lpq.sphincsVerify(sphincsKey.publicKey, message, sphincsSignature)
```

Persist your own durable high-water leaf index alongside a leanXMSS key's `toBytes()` and advance
it before publishing a signature. `toBytes()` is secret material: the leanXMSS seed, or the
leanSPHINCS seed followed by its kept height. `XmssSecretKey.prepare(leafIndex)` builds the bottom
tree a leaf index falls in ahead of signing there.

## Aggregation

`aggregate` verifies every raw signature before proving and runs one proof at a time per process.
`Aggregate.fromBytes` verifies the proof it decodes, so every `Aggregate` is proven. An aggregate
attests the claims it lists, not the claims you wanted: compare `xmssClaims` and `sphincsClaims`
against what you expect. `setup()` moves the one-time guest build ahead of the first proof;
calling it is optional and idempotent.

```js
const leaf = await lpq.aggregate({
  xmss: [{ publicKey: xmssKey.publicKey, message, signature: xmssSignature }],
  sphincs: [{ publicKey: sphincsKey.publicKey, message, signature: sphincsSignature }],
})
const root = await lpq.aggregate({ children: [leaf] })

const received = await lpq.Aggregate.fromBytes(root.toBytes())
received.xmssClaims // [{ publicKey: xmssKey.publicKey, message }]
received.sphincsClaims // [{ publicKey: sphincsKey.publicKey, message }]
```

One aggregation takes seconds and about 1.6 GB of memory.

## Development

Install Node.js 18.17 or later and Rust, then run:

```sh
cd bindings/node
npm ci
npm run build
npm test
```

`npm run build` compiles in release mode; debug builds of leanVM prove roughly 30x slower.

`npm/` holds the per-platform package manifests. `napi create-npm-dirs` generates them from
`package.json`'s `napi.targets`; rerun it and commit the result after changing the targets.

## Releasing

Each `vX.Y.Z` release tag publishes `@kevaundray/lean-pq` and every platform package at version
`X.Y.Z` from `.github/workflows/release.yml`, independently of the PyPI publish:

1. `node-build` stamps the version and builds one addon per target.
2. `node-package` fills the platform packages, sets the root package's `optionalDependencies` with
   `napi pre-publish --skip-optional-publish`, and packs every tarball.
3. `node-test` installs the root and platform tarball on each platform and signs, verifies and
   aggregates through them (`scripts/install-check.sh`).
4. `node-publish` publishes the platform packages, then the root package, with npm trusted
   publishing. npm adds provenance automatically. Versions already on npm are skipped, so a
   failed run can be re-dispatched on the same tag: `gh workflow run release.yml --ref vX.Y.Z`.

CI checks the packaging without publishing: it packs the root and Linux x64 packages, installs both
tarballs into a fresh project, and runs `scripts/smoke.js` against them. To run it locally after
`npm run build`:

```sh
pack=$(mktemp -d)
cp lean_pq_node.linux-x64-gnu.node npm/linux-x64-gnu/
npm pack --ignore-scripts --pack-destination "$pack"
npm pack --ignore-scripts --pack-destination "$pack" ./npm/linux-x64-gnu
sh scripts/install-check.sh "$pack/kevaundray-lean-pq-0.0.0-dev.tgz" \
  "$pack/kevaundray-lean-pq-linux-x64-gnu-0.0.0-dev.tgz" --aggregate
```

### One-time npm setup

npm can attach a trusted publisher only to a package that already exists, so the first release
publishes the eight packages with a short-lived token, and later releases use trusted publishing.
A platform package added later, such as `@kevaundray/lean-pq-win32-x64-msvc`, goes through the
same steps on the first release that includes it; `node-package` warns about every package not
yet on npm.

1. From the npm account that owns the `@kevaundray` scope, create a **granular access token** on
   npmjs.com (**Access Tokens → Generate New Token → Granular Access Token**) with read and write
   access to packages, a short expiry such as 7 days, and no other permissions. If your account
   requires two-factor authentication for publishing, allow the token to bypass it; CI cannot
   answer a 2FA prompt.
2. Store it as a repository secret:

   ```sh
   gh secret set NPM_TOKEN -R ethereum/lean-pq-bindings
   ```

3. Cut a release. `node-publish` tries trusted publishing first, falls back to the token, and
   publishes `@kevaundray/lean-pq` and the seven platform packages with provenance.
4. Add a trusted publisher to each of the eight packages, on npmjs.com under the package's
   **Settings → Trusted publishing**, or with npm 11.15 or later:

   ```sh
   npm trust github <package> --repo ethereum/lean-pq-bindings --file release.yml --env npm --allow-publish --yes
   ```

   The fields are repository `ethereum/lean-pq-bindings`, workflow `release.yml`, environment
   `npm`, with `npm publish` allowed.
5. Delete the secret and revoke the token, then set each package's **Settings → Publishing
   access** to "Require two-factor authentication and disallow tokens":

   ```sh
   gh secret delete NPM_TOKEN -R ethereum/lean-pq-bindings
   ```
