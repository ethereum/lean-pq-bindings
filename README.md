# lean-pq-bindings

Language bindings for [leanVM](https://github.com/leanEthereum/leanVM)'s post-quantum signatures:
stateful **leanXMSS**, stateless **leanSPHINCS**, and zkVM-backed recursive aggregation of both into
one proof. Every binding wraps the safe Rust facade in [`bindings/rust`](bindings/rust/README.md),
which pins leanVM by git revision and keeps the proving parameters internal.

## Install

Every package is released together from one version: each `vX.Y.Z` release publishes all of them
at `X.Y.Z`. Prebuilt packages need no Rust toolchain.

| Language | Package | Prebuilt for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Python](bindings/python/README.md) ≥ 3.11 | `py-lean-pq` on PyPI | Linux x86_64/aarch64 (glibc, musl), macOS arm64, Windows x86_64 |
| [Node.js](bindings/node/README.md) ≥ 18.17 | `@kevaundray/lean-pq` on npm | Linux x64/arm64 (glibc, musl), macOS x64/arm64, Windows x64 |
| [Java](bindings/java/README.md) 25 | `io.github.crate-crypto:lean-pq` on Maven Central | Linux x86_64/aarch64 (glibc 2.17+), macOS x86_64/arm64, Windows x86_64 |
| [Go](bindings/go/README.md) ≥ 1.24 | `github.com/ethereum/lean-pq-bindings/bindings/go` | Linux amd64/arm64 (glibc), macOS amd64/arm64, Windows amd64 |
| [Zig](bindings/zig/README.md) ≥ 0.16 | package attached to each GitHub release | Linux x86_64/aarch64 (glibc), macOS x86_64/aarch64, Windows x86_64 |
| [Rust](bindings/rust/README.md) | `lean-pq` from this repository (git) | built from source |

The x86_64 builds require a CPU with AVX2 and PCLMULQDQ.

### Python

<!-- x-release-please-start-version -->
```sh
pip install py-lean-pq==0.8.0
```
<!-- x-release-please-end -->

### Node.js

<!-- x-release-please-start-version -->
```sh
npm install @kevaundray/lean-pq@0.8.0
```
<!-- x-release-please-end -->

npm installs the binary for your platform through an optional dependency; installing with
`--omit=optional` leaves the package unable to load.

### Java

Gradle (Kotlin DSL):

<!-- x-release-please-start-version -->
```kotlin
implementation("io.github.crate-crypto:lean-pq:0.8.0")
```
<!-- x-release-please-end -->

Maven:

<!-- x-release-please-start-version -->
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.github.crate-crypto</groupId>
  <artifactId>lean-pq</artifactId>
  <version>0.8.0</version>
</dependency>
```
<!-- x-release-please-end -->

The jar bundles the native library for each platform. Run with
`--enable-native-access=org.ethereum.leanpq`.

### Go

<!-- x-release-please-start-version -->
```sh
go get github.com/ethereum/lean-pq-bindings/bindings/go@v0.8.0
```
<!-- x-release-please-end -->

The module links a bundled static library through cgo, so it needs `CGO_ENABLED=1` and a C
compiler: gcc or clang on Linux, the Xcode command line tools on macOS, and MinGW-w64 gcc on
Windows.

### Zig

<!-- x-release-please-start-version -->
```sh
version=0.8.0
zig fetch --save=lean_pq "https://github.com/ethereum/lean-pq-bindings/releases/download/v$version/lean-pq-zig-$version.tar.gz"
```
<!-- x-release-please-end -->

Then add the module in `build.zig`:

```zig
const lean_pq = b.dependency("lean_pq", .{ .target = target, .optimize = optimize });
exe.root_module.addImport("lean_pq", lean_pq.module("lean_pq"));
```

On Windows the bundled archive targets Zig's default `x86_64-windows-gnu` ABI.

### Rust

The crate is not on crates.io because it depends on leanVM by git revision:

<!-- x-release-please-start-version -->
```toml
[dependencies]
lean-pq = { git = "https://github.com/ethereum/lean-pq-bindings.git", tag = "v0.8.0" }
```
<!-- x-release-please-end -->

## Build from source

Clone the repository and follow each binding's README; every binding builds against the
repository's pinned leanVM revision. Building needs Rust, plus the language toolchain:

| Binding | Local build and test | Prerequisites |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Python](bindings/python/README.md) | `uv run --extra dev maturin develop --release`, then `uv run --extra dev pytest tests/` in `bindings/python` | Rust, uv |
| [Node.js](bindings/node/README.md) | `npm ci && npm run build && npm test` in `bindings/node` | Rust, Node.js 18.17+ |
| [Java](bindings/java/README.md) | `gradle -p bindings/java test` | Rust, JDK 25, Gradle 9.1+ |
| [Go](bindings/go/README.md) | stage the static archive (below), then `go test ./...` in `bindings/go` | Rust, Go 1.24+, cgo, Zig, `cargo-zigbuild` |
| [Zig](bindings/zig/README.md) | stage the static archive (below), then `zig build test -Dnative-dir=…` in `bindings/zig` | Rust, Zig 0.16+, `cargo-zigbuild` |
| [Rust](bindings/rust/README.md) | `cargo test --release -p lean-pq` | Rust |

Go and Zig link a static archive for the build target. For Linux x86_64:

```sh
rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
cargo install cargo-zigbuild --locked
sh bindings/native/scripts/stage-static.sh x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu bindings/go/internal/native/linux_amd64
```

Zig takes the same archive's directory as `-Dnative-dir`; the Go README lists the directory for
each platform.

Each binding uses a language-native wrapper around the Rust implementation. The internal
[`bindings/native`](bindings/native/README.md) crate supplies a private C-shaped Rust ABI for
managed wrappers: Java consumes it through the Foreign Function & Memory API, while Go and Zig
link its static archive. It is not a separate, supported C binding.

## Releases

[release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) keeps a release pull request open
from the conventional commits on `main`. Merging it bumps the version everywhere it appears,
including the install instructions above, and tags `vX.Y.Z`. That tag runs
`.github/workflows/release.yml`, which builds and tests every package on each platform before
publishing it. See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).
